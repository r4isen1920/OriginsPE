# OriginsPE

OriginsPE (Portable Edition) is a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Add-On that allows you to select an Origin at the start of the game. Each Origin has their own unique abilities, advantages, and disadvanatages. Moreoever, you can also be able to pick your Class. Classes, on the other hand, may complement whatever Origin of your choosing. Or just be a Human, a regular playthrough of Minecraft as is.
